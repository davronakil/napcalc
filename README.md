# About
Nap–°alc is a simple responsive web app that helps you calculate when to go to sleep and/or when to wake up using sleep cycles, helping you wake up refreshed. 

# How to use it
You launch it, you pick the time when you will go to sleep (it will autoselect the current time on your device, assuming you are going to sleep right now), click "Calculate". NapCalc will give you a list of different times for when to set your alarm to. Each option is 1 full REM cycle. The darker the option, the more sleep cycles.
